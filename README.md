# Bragg&Sons
<hr>
<p> Bragg&Sons are a family of local painters that have been in the business for a very long time.</p><p>
They have a very established long standing customer base but would like to grow new business on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>They have tried social media without much sucess, so we have suggested Bragg&Sons have their own website on which they can tie it all together.

##Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
<ul>
<li>JQuery
<p>The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing</p>
<li>In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.</li>

<li>Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.</li>

<li>For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:</li>

<li>Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

(You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.)
One of the initial challenges which im sure is quiet normal when writing code was the accidental deletion or addition of a parenthesis,
when editing code. The knockon effect being the whole layout of the site suddenly not looking right. Intially I tried to find these manually until I realised that I could just use the online css/html code validators and use the direct input method to quickly scan the code which saved a lot of time.
</li>
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<li>Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.</li>

##Credits
###Content
The text for all sections was created by myself derived from a conversation with a local painter.
###Media
The photos used in this site were obtained from
The braggandsons logo was borrowed from www.brandcrowd.com.
The logo was picked out I addded the text and style I then saved a screenshot.
I understand that this is not the correct way to acquire or borrow images but to purchase the icon was quiet expensive and since I will only be using this for educational purposes i did not see an issue with it.
The testimonails on the about page were created by myself just the images we borrowed by doing a google search of "picture of a happy person", "picture of a smiling person", picture of a smiling older person, "picture of a smiling couple in new house", "picture of a smiling older couple"


###Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from a conversation with a local painter.
The name Bragg&Sons and any contact information is ficticious and does not represent the actual painters details to protect his identity.
