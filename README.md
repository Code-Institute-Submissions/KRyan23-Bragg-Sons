# Bragg&Sons
<hr>
<p> Bragg&Sons are a family of local painters that have been in the business for a very long time.</p><p>
They have a very established long standing customer base but would like to grow new business on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>They have tried social media without much sucess, so we have suggested Bragg&Sons have their own website on which they can tie it all together.
