### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.


        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with text above it "Munsters Most Trusted Painters".
        2. The main points are immediately met with the brief description of what the business is reinforced wit the puicture of a newly decorated room.
        3. The user has three options, scroll down and click the Gallery or the Testimonal page, or scroll down futher and click the call to action button "Get Your Free Quote Today", the link for the Gallery brings them to the gallery page, the link for the Testimonals bring them to the testimonial page and the "Get Your Free Quote Today" brings them to the quote page.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find contact information.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page the user will end up at.
        2. At the bottom of the index,services,about and gallery pages there is a call to action "Top of page" to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact and Quote pages, after a form response is submitted, the formdump.codeinstitute.net service displays the values inputed from the user, if this were a prduction site the user would be redirected to a landing page with all the familiar navigation and message to say the response was recieved.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what people think of their service.

        1. Once the new visitor lands on the page they are presented with intuitive naviagation on the top right of the page.
        2. The user then has 2 ways to reach testimonials, they can select it directly from the navigation or if they scroll down to the Thumbnails picutre of testimonials and click the link here.
        3. The user can then review the testimonails here or scroll down to the social media links at the bottom of the page to investigate further.
